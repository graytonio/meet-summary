[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:32:23
How'd you like it?

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:32:28
That's that's a poc right there, I told you it can work.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:32:28
You see it cannot be the background. And it is. You don't really hear it, and it's it's what's the music you want.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:32:35
It's really good music. It's kind of.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:32:38
So it's all these other things.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:32:43
Alright!

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:32:47
I'll see there's the difference, because you listen to like very chilled out music to focus.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:32:51
I need something that is like 200. It is little, just like the fastest beat that I can find.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:32:54
Exactly.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:33:02
I get that?

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:02
That's how I need to focus what's up.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:33:05
I get that sometimes sometimes when I drive really fast cars, it's the same.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:06
Yeah.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:33:11
Just give me the highest rating machine possible. Then I'll focus.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:15
But he says, you guys, do active. But I'm just.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:21
I just want to relax. But I'm going.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:24
I just put some bread music on. That's it to say, like, Yeah, we do this because my like focus music is like a 180 beats coming up.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:33:34
Jordi is like 30 beats per minute. I don't know.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:37
Yeah. Yup, very different. How does that?

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:45
The relax, let's see if it's in my dad.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:48
I think we need it from him. As any works. He has Bragan music playing and everyone just relaxes it.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:33:57
's so true. But like when it's my turn and it's French Canadian grass, what are we gonna do?

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:34:06
I like in this story. Tell me about. I can say, Okay, you know what I'm just gonna do this thing so we can see you. The butt.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:34:15
I can say, Okay, you know what? I'm just gonna no, but you get the idea, you know, it wouldn't be useful.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:34:25
I'm sorry. All right, I'm gonna just you can say, all right. I'm gonna just mute for a minute.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:34:27
I'm listening to it. Then I say, Hey, the sound is done, though you know you.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:34:32
You could select, and his own calls, and it's like it's going crazy in places, are you know what this is not for me?

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:34:44
I will mute this one.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:34:51
Our notification comes up on the screen, says Grayton's fast music is finished, and Jonah's slow music is done.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:00
Had. Our music is upcoming. So there's something why don't we just be a shared spotify playlist?

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:35:02
You know, that's.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:05
Would that of scratch be good?

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:35:07
For that, for that Jordan will have to opt in the spotify.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:35:13
Jordan, how long have you been in the Us.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:15
Well, I'll be here well, I don't really have those those things. I don't.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:21
I don't know what I see that I have to pay for them.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:28
Every time I really should ordered that you can get a free subscription for free like from day frog that's the key is then. Yes, I I will go with that cause. I don't know.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:35:29
It's less than guess it's less than cheese budget.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:35:34
Okay.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:51
I just can't do. I will not be.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:54
I see you're you don't want to be a part of it.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:35:57
Dude. It cost less than potatoes.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:35:58
Yes.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:00
That is true. Yeah, for one month it's less than selfish and accurate or accurate, selfish.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:11
But that is true, but I can't. Some of these nourishments, you know that that's.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:36:14
It's less than one RAM bottle. It's it's it's like such a tiny line item in your budget.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:21
You will make it alright. I will do it. I I will get.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:36:23
Then.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:27
I tried to get on music, but this time.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:36:29
And and then you could open the playlist for the team.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:36:32
I'm already be surprised.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:33
Yeah, I'm gonna do some of the spotify. I'm gonna chat. But I don't know the difference between them.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:39
Is there a big difference? Is that a big difference? Spotlight is a little better, but also a little worse, so, as far as, like the amount of music you'll be able to listen to, there's no difference except for that one Taylor swift Album.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:52
But I don't think that's gonna bother me if you'll be able to listen to.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:55
There's no difference except for that one Taylor swift Album.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:36:56
But yeah, in my opinion, spotify as a more mature music stream, platform.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:03
Okay, like they have. They're like they have nicer features.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:37:05
I'd go with Spotify.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:09
And I like their recommendation system perhaps I think it has a better ui I like the recommendation system, but, like the I think it has a better ui, that's where it shows you like the songs that you listen to the most like summarizes your whole year, of listening

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:25
I don't know. It's like I think the ui is better.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:27
I think, you know, it's just easier. It makes a playlist, but like it shares like my music like makes music.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:35
For example, of a playlist, but, like it, shares like my new stick with like mixed music. For example, we can listen to like each other, songs playlist like it's a bunch of like really cute features like that.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:41
Like they just have a thing where you can make a time.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:43
Cancel for yourself.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:37:50
Actually use the permutations actually, user recommendations. It's really good you could discover new artists from the journal that you like.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:37:53
Yeah, yeah, when I use that for music, which I did for years.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:37:58
It's actually good.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:02
And I graduated spotify like 2 years ago, I listen to like the same 10 songs, for, like 2 years.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:10
And after I got spotified I realized, now there's a whole world of French Canadian folk, there's more like to like this.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:20
Alright!

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:38:23
Like my brother uses predominantly for music. Discovery, like he listens to the same song.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:27
Yeah.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:38:28
Maybe 3 days, and then he's done for it.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:34
I have the same hi the same power. If I'm working with spotify on, there's but my, what I usually end up doing is the first like 10 songs in like my recently saved just get looped over and over and over again, until like a week or 2 passes and i'm

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:38:49
Done with them. New Chapter.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:50
like, Oh, I want to find new phones.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:53
Like it is funny, like if I'm driving in the car 'cause I don't really make like playlist.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:38:57
I just kind of started the top of my like songs and go down for some reason that's on my list.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:39:00
Same.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:04
For some reason shuffling doesn't work like it hears me out I don't know why it's not that good to like. If you look at your queue, and you don't like it.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:14
You try to shuffle and still keep the next 5 songs or something I get to like.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:39:17
My shuffle is like really odd.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:23
Distracted by the fact. I don't know what's coming next.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:26
So my attention gets like a lot. But if I just go down like the list of like songs, I always know it's coming back so I can just listen to relax.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:39:32
It prevented the playlist.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:34
It's a bit I've never understood why my brain works like that.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:36
But I'm just like, Okay, that's for it.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:40
But you might not like it, which one Dhd.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:44
No, not that far.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:39:51
And it doesn't try. Try, spotify up, and then you could have jams with your team. I'm all for it.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:55
Yeah.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:39:57
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just gonna be very good music.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:02
I don't listen to anything too fast songs that you play when you take this place.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:14
Is this natural music? What are they doing the only thing I need to do now, whenever I listen to it is, I need to be by the the apartment your apartment.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:40:24
Hmm!

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:40:26
Right.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:27
So that was, yeah. That was like what I mean, that is about the generic kind of sense.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:34
I don't know if it will work when that happens.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:36
If I hear that what the fall in the background? Reagan music! Oh, that's it!

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:40
That's it.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:40:40
You'll enjoy it, I mean I'm afraid of my shuffle mode, because the song still have very different vibes.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:40:48
You'll hear like a classical then R and B faster, Edm, and then, you know.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:51
Oh, yeah, me, too, it jumps around way too often for it to be like a viable option.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:40:55
Yeah.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:40:58
Yeah for me. When the k-pop comes on after the country music, I do get with it all comes on after the country music I did get withlash. Yeah, well, I have like it's sending an amate opening to country music to like punk rock it's it's too much all the time like my

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:15
spotify is fairly like normal music, but like my music, history is pretty nice.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:20
Yeah. Yes, like, there's one mixed that I found.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:26
That's like, apparently, that might bring like a lot.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:29
So that's the one that I just have all the time.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:34
It's like, apparently, that my brain likes a lot. So that's the one that I just have all the time.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:35
It's like a 2 h exercise, so like by the time it's over, it's like, I don't know what that's like.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:37
That's just another. Yeah.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:41:42
So!

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:41:45
One take away from the Daily Jordan other than spotify.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:41:51
Hello! Well, changes with Crm next, so I won't see what actually performs I want to see the results of the both are great.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:07
I want to see here much tomorrow, but that's in the policy.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:12
And what this was. There we choose the meetings. So we adjusted those meetings as well.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:20
I think that's pretty much about it for for the for this.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:42:23
So you got what you wanted out of the daily. Good! Hello!

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:26
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry I got distracted because I'm on call.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:31
But my takeaway is that we have. Let's meet examples, which is exactly what I wanted for my third day.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:42
So the vacation for streaming, too. Maybe it'll stop making fun of me for it.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:42:47
For your birthday.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:50
Vindication for Training.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:42:52
Again. Could you repeat?

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:42:56
For training, I'm thinking I can't pick up the word.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:43:00
Just write it. Just write it on slack. The caption didn't say.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:43:14
No just like vindication for him, because he makes fun of me like once every couple weeks.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:43:19
For one, I said, on my first week about there's too many meetings.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:43:24
No, I mean let's just start it this way. You're the most alert, and you speak first.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:43:29
So we appreciate it. I mean, I think the only exception is that today, Jordan, during lunch said, Hey, maybe we should adjust those meetings, and I told them, Hey, now that you're in the office, I'm glad that you spoke up.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:43:44
And only at this occasion. Jordan was first, but you kind of canceled it out when all of us were waiting in the room for you, so!

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:43:59
It's it's good.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:44:01
To just speak up whenever you have a anything, any thought, great One takeaway.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:44:13
I think the main thing is our schedules look a little more free up, which which is nice because it's been cluttering calendar a little bit.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:44:21
Okay.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:44:24
So none of you said what I actually wanted you to say so I'll just reiterate whenever we have a doubt about a case that's escalated to us.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:44:35
So long ago that I forgot.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:44:35
If we're not sure what to do if we're not, that's why I'm reiterating at the end of the that's fine.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:44:43
I don't trust one individual to summarize.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:44:45
I just want you all to be attentive. At the end of the meeting.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:44:47
And once you try and come up with a takeaway, then I think you'll actually try and get recollection.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:44:55
In that case we had, like malformed or misinformed request, just wanted to buy me before you shoot any.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:05
Nakis's comments, ask whatever needs to be done.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:09
Sometimes we will decline the request. Sometimes we will be creative about.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:45:14
So I. I have a question now, because, you know that was my ticket, and I did ask you about it.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:45:21
And you said like like you, it gave me a reflag to do it, so.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:29
We could reread the chat. I may have mistaken there as well for me.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:34
At that time it was pretty obvious that we would. I stand corrected.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:38
We probably shouldn't.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:43
Yeah. And as I said, I probably make mistakes as well, and it's good that you're holding me.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:45:47
Yeah, I mean, I didn't wanna like throwing under the bus.

[ATL - WonderFrog] 13:45:51
But I was just wondering if I misremembered what happened.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:55
No, no, it was. It's exactly what happened.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:45:57
I just received. What was it? We could reread the chat, but that was the intention.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:46:04
Right. I'll give you a bit of time to breathe before the Us.

[Saar Moshiashvili] 13:46:09
Daily. But I really had a blessed with you guys, and see in a bit.
